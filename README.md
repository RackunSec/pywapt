# Pywapt
Set of Python Tools for Web Application Penetration Tests. Over time, I find myself writing more and more of these simple tools, so I will place them all in a single place here.
## TOOLS
* [URL-Full Encoder](tools/encoding/url-full-encoder.py) - Encodes ***every byte*** of a string to be used for obfuscation purposes. e.g: XSS+Phishing.
* [HTML-Comment-Scraper](tools/enum/html-comment-scraper.py) - Encodes every byte of a string to be used for obfuscation purposes. e.g: XSS+Phishing.
